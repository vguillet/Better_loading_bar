# Better_loading_bar


"Add a fully-featured loading bar to any loop type and process in just two lines!"

```python
[â—‹] Demo bar | 0370/1000 - [===========>                   ] - 37%   - iter/s: 0.08s - Run time: 0.08s - ETA: 51.70s
```

**Better_loading_bar** is a single script, multi-function, and multi-option class meant to allow for easy setting up and tracking of tasks progress. 

Integration is kept as simple as possible, while giving the user full access to a significant number of usefull information such as ETA, run time, completion, etc... The progress bar also contains an **activity indicator**, which allows for easy determination of ongoing processes existance (useful for long loops).

The bar can be used for *while* loops too. This allows to provides information and insight on the iterations (providing run_time, and total run time for example).

The progress bar can be run on a single line or can update over new lines as process proceeds (to allow for information to be printed in between).

The bar is fully customisable, just set to *False* all unwanted information and parameters at initiation. Various bar and activity tracker designs are available for optimal visual effects.

```python
Progress_bar(max_step=maxi_step,
             label="Demo bar",
             process_count=True,
             progress_percent=True,
             run_time=True,
             average_run_time=True,
             eta=True,
             overwrite_setting=True,
             bar_type="Equal",
             activity_indicator_type="Pie stack",
             rainbow_bar=False)
```

ANSI colours are used to enhance readability, but require compatible install to be visible (progress bar will work regardless). A special **Rainbow mode** is available for maximum visibility!

### Progress bar:

Progress bars are used to keep track of pre-defined length processes. To create a progress bar, simply initiate an instance of the progress bar (specify the wanted information there, max_step must be specified).

```python
bar =  Progress_bar(max_step=30)
```

Run `.update_progress` to update progress (for loops) and/or `.update_activity` to keep the activity animations going between main progress updates (when minor progress is made during a long loop for example). A label for the current ongoing process can be specified to keep track of sub-task in a large loop consisting of multiple steps.

```python
bar.update_progress(self, current=None, current_process_label=None)

bar.update_activity()
```

*Tips: In case of very short itteration loops, disable "activity_indicator" 

### Activity bar

Activity bars are used to keep track of unknown-length processes (while loops).
To create an activity bar, simply initiate an instance of the progress bar (specify the wanted information there, keep max_step to None):

```python
bar =  Progress_bar(max_step=None)
```

Run `.update_activity` at the end of every iteration to update activity.

```python
bar.update_activity()
```
